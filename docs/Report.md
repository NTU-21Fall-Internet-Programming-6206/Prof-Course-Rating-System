# Development Report of Professor&Course Rating Application

## 1. Project Scenario

At the beginning of every semester, NTU students need to register courses that they want to take. Usually, the deadline of the course registration is the end of week 2. To decide whether to take a course, students can read the course’s syllabus, and experience the classes in the first two weeks. However, these may be not enough for students to make a good decision. To know about the professor and his/her course more clearly, additional information from those who have taken the course will be helpful.

The Professor & Course Rating System (PCRA) provide a platform where students can publish their comments and rates on a specific professor and his/her course anonymously. Students can also search the professor or the course by name to browse the comments and rates on the professor or the course. All comments and rates are shown anonymously but students can still change or delete their previous comments and rates.

The main users of PCRA are Students and Application Administrator (AA).
